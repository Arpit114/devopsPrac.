<p>DevOps is a Technology , away from coding world but acts as a base for handling tasks of Developers and Operators in such a way that everything is optimized.
The goal in DevOps is to make everything faster with least human intervention to avoid conventional errors.</p>

<p align='Justify'>For example: Every program needs a system/OS to run , Now think that you have a website and at certain time ,only 100 people can have access to that website. 
This website is a program which needs to be run as a process on an Operating System(every program needs an OS to run) . 
This OS can run on a simple system , over a cloud , virtual machine etc. But there are always some limitations i.e. the RAM and Processor.</p>

</p align='Justify'>Now think that some day , the people accessing your website at a particular time get increased to 400 and at that time your website will get crashed as its process can only accomodate 100 people at a time.</p>

<p align='Justify'>So, to solve this problem , you need to load more Operating systems and load the website website from those systems so that it can accomodate 400 people . But , Here comes the limitation....</p>
<p align='Justify'>>>> To start a system, to Boot a OS and load the website, you need too much time and during that time your website will remain crashed or some of the users have to wait to get access .</p>
<p align='Justify'>Here comes DevOps , you can maintain the huge burden on website in the best way and in the fastest way by starting the OS in less than a second with least resources , Load balancing the users of the website over multiple systems and do faster updates of the content of that website.</p>
<small><i><p>Many subtopics or technologies of DevOps are Docker , Kubernetes , Jenkins , Graphana etc.</i></small></p>
